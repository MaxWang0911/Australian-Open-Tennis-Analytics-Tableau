# 🎾 Australian Open Tennis Analytics (1905–2025)

This Tableau-based project explores over a century of Australian Open Grand Slam data (1905–2025), with a focus on uncovering trends, national patterns, and the dominance of top players.

## 📊 Objectives
- Analyze long-term performance patterns of Australian Open champions and runner-ups
- Compare player win efficiency by sets, gender, and seed ranking
- Explore country-level tennis dominance and gender balance over time
- Identify standout athletes using calculated metrics and normalized comparisons

## 📁 Project Files
- `14403000_A2.twb` – Tableau workbook file
- `14403000_A2.pdf` – Full report (with visual explanations and findings)
- `README.md` – Project overview

## 🧰 Tools & Techniques
- **Tableau** – Used for building dashboards and interactive storytelling
- Excel – Used for initial data cleaning and metric calculation (e.g. win rate, sets won)
- Calculated Fields – Used to identify top players (≥5 wins), normalize win rates, and assign custom groupings

## 📈 Key Visualisations
- **Treemaps, Maps, Stacked Bar Charts** – For national distribution of winners
- **Scatter Charts** – Sets vs Win Rate, Seed Rank vs Win Rate
- **Timeline & Area Charts** – Cumulative wins by top players
- **Parallel Coordinates & Normalized Charts** – Cross-set performance comparisons
- **Word Cloud** – Frequent finalists visualization

## 🎯 Key Findings
- 🇦🇺 Australia leads in both champions and runner-ups historically
- 🏆 Novak Djokovic & Margaret Court emerge as top performers in both win rate and match volume
- 🧬 Seed ranking doesn’t always correlate with performance—upsets happen
- 🧭 Players like Federer, Serena, and Emerson show unique match-set strengths (e.g., strong finishes or early wins)

## 🧠 Reflections
Tableau enables intuitive exploration of historical sports data and supports powerful storytelling via its visual encodings. However, it has limitations in advanced statistical processing compared to tools like Python and R.
